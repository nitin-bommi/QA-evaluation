Answer:
Autoencoders are deep learning models used for unsupervised learning, consisting of input, encoder, bottleneck hidden, decoder, and output layers. The encoder compresses input data into a compact summary, the bottleneck hidden layer represents the most important features, and the decoder reconstructs the data from its encoded form. Practical uses include text summarization and generation in algorithms like Transformers and Big Bird, image compression, and a nonlinear version of PCA. Other parameters that can be adjusted include dropout rate, kernel, activation function, and number of epochs for training.

Context: [Document(page_content='---

Answer:
An activation function is a mathematical function used in neural networks to introduce non-linearity and decide whether a neuron should be activated or not. It transforms the weighted sum of inputs into outputs, such as the sigmoid function (f(x) = 1/(1+exp(-x))) for classification, ReLU (f(x) = max(0,x)) for faster computation, and tanh for better gradient flow. The choice of activation function depends on the specific task and network architecture.

- Signs of under-fitting during training include a model not fitting the training data well.
- Large learning rates, improper initialization, excessive regularization, and vanishing gradients can all lead to under-fitting.
- Exploding gradients occur when updates to weights and biases become excessively large, resulting in overflow or NaN values.
- The vanishing gradient problem occurs when gradients become too small during training, preventing weight updates.

Question: Can you explain the parameter sharing concept in deep learning? 
Context: [Document(page_content='Parameter sharing is the method of sharing weights by all neurons in a particular feature map. Therefore helps to reduce the number of parameters in the whole system, making it computationally cheap. It basically means that the same parameters will be used to represent different transformations in the system. This basically means the same matrix elements may be updated multiple times during backpropagation from varied gradients. The same set of elements will facilitate transformations at more than one layer instead of those from a single layer as conventional. This is usually done in architectures like Siamese that tend to have parallel trunks trained simultaneously. In that case, using shared weights in a few layers( usually the bottom layers) helps the model converge better. This behavior, as observed, can be attributed to more diverse feature representations learned by the system. Since neurons corresponding to the same features are triggered in varied scenarios. Helps to model to generalize better.', metadata={'source': 'textbook.md'}), Document(page_content='Note that sometimes the parameter sharing assumption may not make sense. This is especially the case when the input images to a ConvNet have some specific centered structure, where we should expect, for example, that completely different features should be learned on one side of the image than another.', metadata={'source': 'textbook.md'}), Document(page_content='One practical example is when the input is faces that have been centered in the image. You might expect that different eye-specific or hair-specific features could (and should) be learned in different spatial locations. In that case, it is common to relax the parameter sharing scheme, and instead, simply call the layer a Locally-Connected Layer.

Hyperparameters are any parameter in the model that affects the performance but is not learned from the data unlike parameters ( weights and biases), the only way to change it is manually by the user.


1. Number of nodes: number of inputs in each layer.

2. Batch normalization: normalization/standardization of inputs in a layer.

3. Learning rate: the rate at which weights are updated.

4. Dropout rate: percent of nodes to drop temporarily during the forward pass.', metadata={'source': 'textbook.md'})] 
Answer:
Parameter sharing in deep learning refers to the method of using the same weights for multiple neurons in a feature map, reducing the number of parameters and making the system computationally cheaper. This allows for diverse feature representations to be learned, improving generalization. However, in cases where input images have specific centered structures, parameter sharing may not make sense, and locally-connected layers may be used instead. Hyperparameters, such as the number of nodes, batch normalization, learning rate, and dropout rate, are manually set by the user and affect the model's performance.

Question: Describe the architecture of a typical Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)? 
Context: [Document(page_content='---

In a typical CNN architecture, a few convolutional layers are connected in a cascade style. Each convolutional layer is followed by a Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) layer or other activation function, then a pooling layer*, then one or more convolutional layers (+ReLU), then another pooling layer.', metadata={'source': 'textbook.md'}), Document(page_content='The output from each convolution layer is a set of objects called feature maps, generated by a single kernel filter. The feature maps are used to define a new input to the next layer. A common trend is to keep on increasing the number of filters as the size of the image keeps dropping as it passes through the Convolutional and Pooling layers.

5. Kernel: matrix to perform dot product of image array with

Answer:
1. A typical CNN architecture consists of multiple convolutional layers, each followed by a ReLU or activation function and a pooling layer.
2. Feature maps are generated by a single kernel filter in each convolutional layer, which are used as input for the next layer.
3. The number of filters increases as the image size decreases through the convolutional and pooling layers. Other parameters such as dropout rate, kernel size, activation function, and number of epochs are also important in CNN architecture. After flattening the final small image with many filters, fully connected layers and a softmax layer are used for classification.

Answer:
The Vanishing Gradient Problem in Artificial Neural Networks occurs when gradients become too small during training, making it difficult for the weights to change. This can happen in networks with many hidden layers, as the gradients in earlier layers become very low due to multiplying derivatives. To fix this, techniques such as Leaky ReLU, LSTM cells, and Batch Normalization can be used to prevent the gradients from vanishing. Additionally, proper initialization, learning rate selection, and regularization hyper-parameter tuning can help prevent under-fitting, over-fitting, exploding gradients, and vanishing gradients.
