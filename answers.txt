Autoencoders are deep learning models used for unsupervised learning, consisting of input, encoder, bottleneck hidden layer, decoder, and output layers. The encoder compresses input data into a compact summary, the bottleneck layer contains important features, and the decoder reconstructs the data. Practical uses include text summarization and generation in algorithms like Transformers and Big Bird, image compression, and a nonlinear version of PCA. Other parameters that can be adjusted include dropout rate, kernel, activation function, and number of epochs for training.

An activation function is a mathematical function used in neural networks to introduce non-linearity and decide whether neurons should be activated or not. It transforms the weighted sum of inputs into outputs, such as the sigmoid function (f(x) = 1/(1+exp(-x))) for classification with output values between 0 and 1, or the ReLU function (f(x) = max(0,x)) for non-negative output values. The use of activation functions is crucial to capture more complex features and model more complex variations that simple linear models cannot capture, making a linear regression model different from a neural network. Other commonly used activation functions include tanh, softmax, and sigmoid.

1. Increase the dataset size through data augmentation or use pre-trained models. 2. Add regularization techniques such as lasso, ridge, or elastic net. 3. Implement dropouts and batch normalization. 4. Consider replacing fully connected layers with convolutional and pooling layers. 5. Evaluate the justification for the number of layers and neurons chosen and consider using pre-trained models. 6. Check for train/valid data contamination and ensure the dataset size is sufficient. 7. Use skip/residual connections, ReLU or Leaky ReLU activation functions, and models that help propagate gradients to earlier time steps like in GRUs and LSTMs. 8. Reduce the learning rate of the model. 9. Ensure the training sample distribution is the same as the validation and test set distribution. 10. Check for reliable and available features in the input data. 11. Avoid train/valid data contamination and ensure the dataset is balanced. 12. Use softmax at the last layer for classification problems and ensure the dataset distribution is the same for validation and test sets. 13.

1. Helps in training deeper neural networks. 2. Improves covariate shift proof NN architecture. 3. Provides a slight regularization effect. 4. Results in centered and controlled values of activation. 5. Helps prevent exploding/vanishing gradient. 6. Faster training and convergence to the minimum loss function. Note: Batch Normalization standardizes the inputs to a layer for each mini-batch during training, which can improve the training process of very deep neural networks by reducing the effects of internal covariate shift and preventing the vanishing/exploding gradient problem. It is typically used on the inputs to a layer before the activation function in the previous layer and after fully connected layers.

1. Poor loss on training data 2. Unstable model with large changes in loss 3. Model loss goes to NaN during training 4. Weights quickly become very large during training 5. Model weights go to NaN values during training 6. Error gradient values consistently above 1.0 for each node and layer during training Note: The first three signs are subtle, while the last three signs are less subtle and confirm the presence of exploding gradients. Other causes of poor performance, such as under-fitting, large learning rates, improper initialization, and large regularization hyper-parameters, should also be considered.

1. Number of nodes: determines the size of each layer in a neural network. 2. Batch normalization: normalizes inputs in a layer to improve training stability and accelerate convergence. 3. Learning rate: controls the step size for updating weights and biases during training. 4. Dropout rate: temporarily drops a percentage of nodes during the forward pass to prevent overfitting. 5. Kernel: matrix used for dot product in convolutional layers. 6. Activation function: transforms the weighted sum of inputs into outputs. 7. Number of epochs: number of passes through the training data. 8. Softmax: used at the last layer for classification problems to return a set of probabilities with a sum of 1. 9. Optimizers: used to fine-tune the learning rate and momentum to find the optimal weights and biases. 10. Learning rate: key to well-trained models, several helpers are used to get it right.

Parameter sharing in deep learning refers to the method of using the same weights for multiple neurons in a feature map, reducing the number of parameters and making the system computationally cheaper. This allows for diverse feature representations to be learned, improving generalization. However, in cases where input images have specific centered structures, parameter sharing may not make sense, and locally-connected layers may be used instead. Hyperparameters, such as the number of nodes, batch normalization, learning rate, and dropout rate, are manually set by the user and affect the model's performance.

1. A typical CNN architecture consists of multiple convolutional layers, each followed by a ReLU or activation function and a pooling layer. 2. Feature maps are generated by a single kernel filter in each convolutional layer, which are used as input for the next layer. 3. The number of filters increases as the image size decreases through the convolutional and pooling layers. Other parameters such as dropout rate, kernel size, activation function, and number of epochs are also important in CNN architecture. After flattening the final small image with many filters, fully connected layers and a softmax layer are used for classification.

The Vanishing Gradient Problem in Artificial Neural Networks occurs when gradients become too small during training, making it difficult for the weights to update. This can happen in networks with many hidden layers, as the gradients in earlier layers become very low due to multiplying derivatives. To fix this, techniques such as Leaky ReLU, LSTM cells, and Batch Normalization can be used to prevent the gradients from vanishing. Additionally, proper initialization, learning rate selection, and regularization hyper-parameter tuning can help prevent under-fitting, large learning rates, improper initialization, and exploding gradients, respectively.

1. The model is under-fitting the training data. 2. The learning rate of the model is large. 3. The initialization is not proper. 4. The Regularisation hyper-parameter is quite large. 5. Classic case of vanishing gradients (when training neural networks with many layers because the gradient diminishes dramatically as it propagates backward through the network). Note: The context provided does not explicitly mention exploding gradients as a reason for the loss not decreasing in a few epochs. However, it does provide some signs to look out for if you suspect exploding gradients as an issue.
