       "'Convolutional neural network (CNN) is a regularized type of feed-forward neural network that learns feature engineering by itself via filters (or kernel) optimization. Vanishing gradients and exploding gradients, seen during backpropagation in earlier neural networks, are prevented by using regularized weights over fewer connections. For example, for each neuron in the fully-connected layer 10,000 weights would be required for processing an image sized 100 × 100 pixels. However, applying cascaded convolution (or cross-correlation) kernels,  only 25 neurons are required to process 5x5-sized tiles. Higher-layer features are extracted  from wider context windows, compared to lower-layer features.\\nThey have applications in: \\n\\nimage and video recognition,\\nrecommender systems,\\n\\nimage classification,\\n\\nimage segmentation,\\n\\nmedical image analysis,\\n\\nnatural language processing,\\n\\nbrain–computer interfaces, and\\n\\nfinancial time series.CNNs are also known as Shift Invariant or Space Invariant Artifi'"
